# Fullstack Arduino LED Toggle Project

## Overview

This project toggles an LED connected to an Arduino via HTTP Requests over my local network using a WiFi module called an ESP8266 that I've wired up to the Arduino. The backend is built with FastAPI, and the frontend with React, Vite, and Redux. The entire project runs in Docker containers.
